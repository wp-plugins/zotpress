Zotpress displays your Zotero citations on WordPress.

== Description ==

[Zotpress](http://katieseaborn.com/plugins/ "Zotpress for WordPress") brings scholarly blogging to WordPress. This plugin displays your [Zotero](http://zotero.org/ "Zotero") citations on your WordPress blog. [Zotero](http://zotero.org/ "Zotero") is a free, cross-platform reference manager that integrates with your browser and word processor.

= Features =
* Displays your individual and group Zotero items through in-text citations and bibliographies
* Leverages WordPress Custom Content Types for greater integration and flexibility
* Provides citation insertion features similiar to those offered by Zotero for word processors
* Supports thumbnail images through WordPress's Featured Image
* Supports selective CSS styling via IDs and classes
* Provides a range of additional features, such as allowing visitors to cite and download citations
* And more!

Compatible with Firefox, Safari, Chrome, IE7, IE8, and IE9. Made with jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery doTimeout, and Live Query.

Special thanks to Joe Alberts for substantial contributions to the code, comprehensive testing, and design ideation. Thanks also to contributors Christopher Cheung and Jason S. for their development support and advice. Finally, my sincere gratitude goes out to all who have donated in support of this plugin.

= Requirements =
jQuery included in your theme (Zotpress will do this for you if it isn't already included), and an HTTP request method supported by WordPress enabled on your server: cURL, fopen with Streams (PHP 5), or fsockopen. Optional: OAuth enabled on your server.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `zotpress` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Place the `[zotpress]` shortcode in your blog entry or enable the Zotpress sidebar widget.

= Shortcode =
You can display your Zotero citations in a number of ways. To display a list of five citations from the collection with the key "ZKDTKM3X", use this shortcode:

[zotpress collection="ZKDTKM3X" limit="5"]

You can also use in-text citations:

[zotpressInText item="{U9Z5JTKC,36-45}"]

This shortcode will display the following in-text citation for the citation with the key "U9Z5JTKC": (Seaborn, 2011, p. 36). The full citation can be displayed in an auto-generated bibliography using the [zotpressInTextBib] shortcode.

Check out the "Help" page on your installation of Zotpress for more information and a full listing of parameters for all shortcodes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The F.A.Q. can be found on the "Help" page of every Zotpress installation. If you have a question that isn't answered there, feel free to post a message in the [forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/zotpress "Zotero forums on Wordpress.com").

== Screenshots ==

1. Browse your Zotero citations by account, collection or tag. Add custom images to citations. Special characters are supported.
2. Search for items and build bibliography and in-text shortcodes using the "Zotpress Reference" meta box widget.
3. Display your Zotero items on your blog. Write scholarly posts with in-text citations and autogenerated bibliographies.

= 1.5 =

= 1.4 =
* Caching enabled, which should speed things up a bit.

= 1.3 =

= 1.2 =
